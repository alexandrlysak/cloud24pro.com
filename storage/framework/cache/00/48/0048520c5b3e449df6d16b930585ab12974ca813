					<p>In order to guarantee compliance of technical conditions with legal requirements, it is necessary to coordinate each step and the subsequent stage by controlling organizations</p>

					<p>The validity of technical specifications may also be limited by law.</p>

					<p>In case of making changes to the production process to the developed conditions, a sheet of changes with the stated amendments is registered.</p>
